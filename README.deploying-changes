Make sure everything you want to commit is committed.

I have a remote for ir.nist.gov called 'ir'

âœ— git remote -v
gitlab  https://oauth2:token@gitlab.nist.gov/gitlab/soboroff/submit-system.git (fetch)
gitlab  https://oauth2:token@gitlab.nist.gov/gitlab/soboroff/submit-system.git (push)
ir      IR:/raids/ir1/submit-system.git (fetch)
ir      IR:/raids/ir1/submit-system.git (push)

/raids/ir1/submit-system.git is a bare repository, so it can be pushed to.  On IR, the deployed system is checked out at /home/ians/submit-system.

'IR' below refers to a host alias in my .ssh/config file for ssh'ing into IR.  You probably have this set up from Darrin... test with 'ssh IR'.

So, once changes are commited:

#if you haven't added the remote
git remote add ir IR:/raids/ir1/submit-system.git

git push ir

ssh IR

cd /home/ians/submit-system
./stop-me.sh
git checkout main
git pull          # this merges the changes you pushed
git checkout deploy
git merge --no-edit main  # and this merges them into the deployed branch
./start-me.sh

I have a post-merge hook set up to build any Java classes that came in with the merge.  If you don't see output like that fly by, you should check evalbase/checkers and confirm that there are .class files and they are newer than the .java files.
