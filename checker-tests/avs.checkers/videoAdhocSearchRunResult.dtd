a single system (variant) run against all the queries

<!-- trtype - system training type (see Guidelines)

     class - processing type ('M' manually assisted,  'F' for "fully automatic", or 'R' for "relevance feedback") 

     task - Task type ('M' Main task, 'P' Progress subtask)

     novelty - Novelty run flag ('N' Novelty run, 'C' Common run - not focused on unique shots)

     pid - short participant ID - taken from the tv*.who.what table in the
           active participant's area of the TRECVID website

  priority - evaluation priority (1,2,...) If not all runs can be
             judged, then judging will begin with the run with priorty
             1 and so on.

     desc - verbal description of the characteristics of this run,
             how it differs in approach, resources, etc from others
             runs.

<!-- tNum - number of the topic (Query ID) searched to produce this result


     elapsedTime - for manually-assisted and relevance feedback searches, the elapsed time in
                   seconds from the time the searcher saw the topic
                   until the searching on that topic ended.

                 - for automatic searches, would be the time in seconds
                   from the time the system is presented with the
                   topic until the searching on that topic ended

<!-- A result item identifies a video clip retrieved as relevant
to the topic for this video search result.

<!ELEMENT item     EMPTY >

<!-- seqNum - a sequence number 1,2,3,...  The lower the sequence
number the greater the likelihood the clip meets the need expressed by
the topic.
              For Ad-hoc search: up to 1000 items may be returned per topic.

     shotId - the id of the shot from the V3C1 standard master shot reference.
              This id is unique across files and take the form of shotxxxx_yyyy

elapsedTime - the elapsed time in seconds from the time the searcher
              saw the topic until this item was added to the result

Explainability options:
timeStamp   - the timestamp (in seconds) of the frame in the shot used to provide a 
              bounding box (ulX, ulY, lrX, lrY) to highlght salient regions highly relevant to the query
              Assume the UpperLeft point in the frame at the timeStamp point has coordinates (0,0)
              and lrX > ulX, lrY > ulY. 
ulX         - the upper left X-coordinate (horizontal) in pixels
ulY         - the upper left Y-coordinate (vertical) in pixels
lrX         - the lower right X-coordinate (horizontal) in pixels
lrY         - the lower right Y-coordinate (vertical) in pixels
